        A. 2 "if name == __main__():"``
        B. Contains window and turtle function, but maybe slight variation.
        C. Make Grid is similar to connect 4
        D. Many Comment blocked lines of code

        2. adjust window and turtle helper graphics file (ref. B)
        3. change function calls to accomodate helper graphics (ref. B)
        4. Implement abstract grid class that can implement both type, design pattern?(ref. C)
        5. Move code blocks into well titled functions (ref. D)
