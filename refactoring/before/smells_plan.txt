Code Smells
    General
        A. 	Make window + make turtle are in both files

        B.	Both main functions start a game and maintain
		 the game, There are lots of comments

    Class Based Pong
        A. 	A couple long lines, conditional and "math one liners"

    Connect 4
        A.	Long conditional checks

        B.	All like one class/function/ global -- check TicTacToe very similar

Refactoring Plan
    General
        1.	Create importable Graphics helper file to import 
		into each game (Ref General A.)


    Class Based Pong
        1.	Move whole main function into a "factory" that sets up game; 
			Break up by comments (Ref General B.)

        2.	Replace inline functions with good variable names 
			ie. new_x instead of x + ball.dx (ref Class Based Pong A.)
		
	
        3.	Encapsulate the long if checks within a function with helpful 
			variable names (ref Class Based Pong A.)

    Connect 4
        1.	Move whole main function into a "factory" that sets up game; 
			Break up by comments (Ref General B.)

        2.	use "flag booleans" that make the line shorter and easier
			to read (ref Connect 4 A.)

        3.	Break global code/ into new functions with comment blocks 
			as names (ref Connect 4 B.)
