# Project 2: Github Pair Programming

The purpose of this project is to utilize pair programming as a means of coverting an infix
mathematical expression into assembly code, mimicking the CPU compiling process in program execution.
More specifically, this program takes in an infix expression as input, evaluate and converts it to
postfix, and finally converts postfix into assembly insrtuctions. 


## Installation

This project requires [Java Platform JDK](https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp) to run. 


## Tech

This project is created using: 
* Java Platform JDK
* Visual Studio Code: 1.61.2


## Setup

To run this program, use the following Terminal commands

To convert an infix expression into postfix (takes infix file as input, exports to new file:

```sh
java Postfix
```


To convert postfix expression into assembly instructions (exports results to new file:

```sh
java Assembler [postfix user input]
```



Using the test files included in this project repository, the expected output would look like this for the two test files:

## Authors

This project was created by Jackie and Philip for the course CS321, using the paired programming approach.


## Acknowledgements

We would like to acknowledge Professor Al Madi for his assistance in creating this project. Without his help
as well as the detailed instructions provided, this project would not have been possible. We would also like to acknowledge
the coursework and material thus far in CS321 for providing us with the information to create this program.
